# Disaster Relief App
The repository for my CPSC 304 project. Credits to my other group members, Andy Xie and Alex Yang! The website is hosted on UBC's undergraduate web servers, and requires an Oracle account.

<!-- ## Using public_html

`chmod -R 755 project_e0g8g_g1q1p_q4p5y/` (Would need to be run every time a php file is added/moved) -->

## Connecting to Oracle DB
Add a `config.ini` file to project's root directory with the following, changing "cwl" to your own CWL and `dbpassword` to 'a' + your student number.
```c
[database]
dbuser = "ora_cwl"
dbpassword = "a12345678"
```
